# LootScout ðŸŽ®

A Browser extension that enhances your Steam browsing experience by providing real-time game deal information and pricing comparisons directly on Steam store pages.

## Features

- **Real-time Deal Comparison**: Compare current Steam prices with the best deals available across multiple platforms
- **Historical Price Tracking**: View historical low prices to make informed purchase decisions
- **Rarity-based Deal Rating**: Games deals are rated using a gaming-inspired rarity system (Common to Iridescent)
- **Steam Deal Analysis**: See how Steam's current discount compares to the best available deals
- **HowLongToBeat Integration**: Quick access to game completion time estimates
- **Clean UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Steam's existing interface

## How It Works

LootScout automatically activates when you visit a Steam game page (`store.steampowered.com/app/*`). It:

1. Extracts the Steam App ID from the current page
2. Fetches pricing data from GG.deals API and Steam Store API
3. Performs price comparisons and calculations
4. Displays deal information in Steam's right sidebar

## Deal Rarity System

Deals are categorized using a rarity system based on discount percentages:

- **Common** (0â€“14%): Small or early discounts
- **Uncommon** (15â€“29%): Light deal
- **Rare** (30â€“44%): Solid discount
- **Epic** (45â€“59%): Good value
- **Legendary** (60â€“79%): Excellent deal
- **Mythic** (80â€“89%): High-tier discounts
- **Exotic** (90â€“99%): Insane value
- **Iridescent** (100%): Press add to account NOW - don't think
